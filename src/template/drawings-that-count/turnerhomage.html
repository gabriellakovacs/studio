{% block aboutProject %}
Han’s analysis of Turner’s tribute to Lorrain finds it is not as faithful as it at first appears. While the architectural fragments in Lorrain’s Antique seaport are all located within the same vanishing point and sun angle, Turner’s fragments not only have their own vanishing points but are also subject to different sun angles: the space has splintered into multiple spatial and temporal domains. Within the space of Antiquity Turner quietly suggests that the subject is either not stationary, or is itself multiplicitous, a crowd.
