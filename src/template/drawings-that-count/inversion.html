{% block aboutProject %}
Inversive geometry constitutes an alternate space (a mapping of Euclidean space through the transformation of inversion) that allows for the resolution of mathematical problems that could not be solved in Euclidean space. The axis of inversion, unlike the axis of symmetry, is a circle of finite radius. It not only divides space but encloses it and sets up an outside and an inside. It flips the relation of these two domains by mapping the space inside the circle outside, and vice versa.
