{% block aboutProject %}
Within the confines of its walls, the Colosseum – a seminal engine of power – generated well-choreographed social orders: relative height, distance, angle, proximity and view were all carefully engineered. Kovács’ temporal mapping of the Colosseum extricates a social hierarchy based on the time it took for various members of Roman society – from senators to slaves – to occupy their designated seats.
